Next time I'll add 1 more Serrano because it wasn't spicy enough. Cooked in Instant Pot - turned it on High 25mins threw everything in, waited for it to sizzle, closed the lid and waited for the timer to go off, natural release 5mins then quick release. Turned out perfect. It was extra saucy which I prefer. Served with Cilantro Lime Rice, Avocado, Sour Cream, &#38; Flour Tortillas"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"FoodFlavourFun"},"reviewBody":"This recipe is utterly delicious and very easy to make! \nLiving in rural Australia (Vic) we are very limited in the variety of chillies available. Basically we have long or short green or red chillies ... and jalapenos. Faced with this sad fact I used about 300g of long green chillies and added one green capsicum and 2 large yellow banana capsicums. This produced a more complex flavour than if I had used only the one type of chilli.\nI'll definitely make this again and I will also plant a large variety of chillies this spring :)"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"skullie666"},"reviewBody":"Copperkettle218 maybe s/he can't eat pork because of religious reasons (Jewish/Muslim), or maybe s/he just plain doesn't like pork? That's why. Recipes aren't dogma, and they don't need to be strictly followed, line-by-line, ingredient-by-ingredient. The art of cooking is being able to change and adapt recipes to your own preferences, using recipes as a general guide. If anything should be more strictly adhered to in a recipe, it's the technique. \n\nBy the way, I've made this numerous times in the Instant Pot, and it turns out fantastic and crowd-pleasing every single time. I've made it with pork and beef, and sometimes I'll add some New Mexico chile powder to make it a Chile Colorado-Chile Verde hybrid. Any way you dice it, it always turns out marvelous!"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"joe schmoe"},"reviewBody":"Sounds delicious!
