I've boiled the squash in the past, and you get an okay soup, but it can't touch the depth of flavor here. \n\nI've noticed that my roasting time always ends up much higher (closer to an hour to get to browned bits on the edges). I suspect three things: (1) I'm probably making my pieces closer to 1.5in; (2) I put them all on one sheet, which though very large and not crowded, probably still inhibits browning a bit; and (3) I think my oven runs a little low (time to buy an oven thermometer!)\n\nI also like to add some vinegar (balsamic, sherry) along with salt and pepper in final tasting before serving. Gives it a little extra zip, which balances the sweet, earthy squash flavor."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rinshinomori"},"reviewBody":"I roasted onion and garlic with the butternut and carrots and that worked out fine instead of cooking them separately.

Both are great recipes! I loved the addition of the spices, sage, and the whipped cream. Next time I’ll add a bit of the sage browned butter to the final soup assembly. I also can’t wait to try some of the variations suggested in other comments. \n\nTip that is probably obvious to others but not to me - the immersion blender does a better job whipping cream in the cup not a bowl."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"petercherman"},"reviewBody":"I'm in the process of making the soup, and I'm using Trader Joe's diced butternut squash.
