I have been searching for a great Chicken Chile Verde recipe for years, and my search is now complete! Even better, it is very quick to prepare with an Instant Pot. I used skinless and boneless chicken breasts (quartered) for quicker preparation and faster shredding in a bowl with a couple of forks. The fish sauce is a great addition for extra depth and umami without any fishy flavor."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Spremutti"},"reviewBody":"I love this recipe. We’re in zone 5 and have grown tomatillos and the peppers successfully. Tomatillos are beautiful plants—but note that you need to grow more than one (they do not self-fertilize!). You may be better off buying seedlings."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandra Weller"},"reviewBody":"I have made this in my Instant Pot multiple times now and it’s been a success every time.
