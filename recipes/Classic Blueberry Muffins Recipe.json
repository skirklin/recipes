It's best when made as written, but once I accidentally added an extra half stick of butter, and once I accidentally doubled the number of eggs-- and both times the muffins came out different, but still tasty. I bought muffin tins for this recipe and I've never regretted that for a moment."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"TwoWheeler"},"reviewBody":"Came out way too stiff for me - cookie dough, rather than \"batter\". \n\n\"Folding in \" in the blueberries was completely out of the question. Best I could do was sort of dump them on top and hope they found their own way in."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carmemily"},"reviewBody":"Great muffins! I usually make cook's illustrated blueberry muffins or smitten kitchen's adaptation of that recipe, but I was out of sour cream and yogurt, so thought I would try Stella's. It definitely registered more muffin/less cake-like than those two recipes. I also liked the extra buttery flavor. I missed, however, the moisture yogurt or sour cream add. So I think I would make these if I knew all would be eaten immediately (while warm), and use one of the other recipes if I needed them to last more than an hour or two."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"BetsyK"},"reviewBody":"I just made these. I used a non-stick muffin pan with cooking spray. I made the muffins as written &#38; confess to adding the zest of a very sad looking lemon. When it came to the blueberries, my frozen stash only had about 1.5 cups, so I reached into a box of very sad fresh berries, and threw maybe 3/4 of a cup in. So I did have too many berries, but in my book, that's not a real problem. I had trouble guaging when they were done...some crumb stuck to the wooden skewer I was using to test doneness, so I also looked for a light brown ring around the muffin. Mine went for 29 minutes. I love the super light (nearly cakey) texture, and the flavor is awesome. Personally, I think I'd like a bit more lemon accent, but the muffins are fantastic."},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"guanciale gal"},"reviewBody":"Too eggy...that's why some complain of a dry muffin..eggs dry out baked goods...also eggs also add egg flavor..I actually love eggless blueberry muffins...the bluberries end up more pronounced in flavor..and moister muffins."}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":["WebPage"],"@id":"https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-blueberry-muffin-recipe","breadcrumb":{"@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@id":"https://www.seriouseats.com/baking-recipes-5117398","name":"Baking"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@id":"https://www.seriouseats.com/muffin-recipes-5117378","name":"Muffins"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@id":"https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-blueberry-muffin-recipe","name":"Classic Blueberry Muffins Recipe"}}]}},"about":[],"url":"https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-blueberry-muffin-recipe"}
