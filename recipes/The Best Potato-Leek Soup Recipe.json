Fortunately there was one recipe which suggested keeping them for stock...I ended up saut&#233;ing them as a base for a pumpkin soup and ate them all. \n\nGuess the concern with the dark green parts is that they may make the soup dark, as it seems the ideal colour for a potato and leek soup is a creamy white. But my suggestion would be if you're fine with it looking darker, include the greens. It seemed terribly wasteful to chuck them out 'cos I'm in South-east Asia where leeks aren't cheap. \n\nAlso for those who prefer a lighter version, I've found the soup works well without milk and/or cream - the potatoes add a lot of richness and make the soup pretty substantial. A swirl of olive oil on top would do the trick."

Running the soup through a chinois helps, but it lacked a richness I would have expected. Perhaps a little flour on the leeks prior to adding the stock (like a veloute) would have helped. Worth experimenting with though."

With so much food wastage in the world, we should be using as much as we can of the vegetable/animal product in our food. With leeks, I usually start the cooking on the chopped greens first, add the whites/lights after. Mo' leeks, mo' flava. \n\nUsing buttermilk in this soup is genius!"
