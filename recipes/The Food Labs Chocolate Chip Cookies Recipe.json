I've been making these cookies for over a year now and they've been a hit every single time. This recipe single-handedly introduced me to the world of brown-butter, which I try to incorporate into everything now.\n\nI would also like people to know that this recipe is \"freezer-friendly,\" so whenever I make a batch, I end up rolling them up into cookie balls and putting them in a freezer bag."

      "reviewBody": "Pro tips for spreading, consistency, and all that jazz!!\nMy first batch's dough looked too loose- so i added a scant 1/2 cup of flour- DON'T DO THIS! Of course they still tasted great, but the texture isn't as amazing if you do this! \nThe reason that some people's dough is too loose (which leads to overspreading) is because they (and I) added the browned butter when it was still a liquid. ADD THE BROWN BUTTER WHEN IT IS COMPLETELY COOLED AND PARTIALLY TURNED BACK INTO A SOLID!!! Think like...the consistency of a moist frosting. LOL :) \nWHIP THE EGGS, SUGAR, AND VANILLA FOR AN ETERNITY!!! If you're using a stand mixer, this might not be the case, but to get the right consistency with a hand mixer, it took me 15+ minutes of constant whipping, with the bowl tilted, at top speed. Consistency is more important than timing here- I knew what to look for cause I've made lots of frostings that use whipped eggs and egg whites. It's difficult to overwhip this mixture because the eggs haven't been heated. Whip like your life depends on it. \nWhat you're looking for is a sense of \"thickness.\" Ribbons are a good descriptor, but remember, IF IT STILL LOOKS WATERY, IF IT'S REALLY RUNNY, AND IT'S NOT FALLING SLOWLY OFF THE BEATERS, IT'S NOT READY!!!\nThe second batch with the extra whipping and without the added flour were literally the best chocolate chip cookies I had ever eaten.\nEXTRA TIPS :)\n1. Pull them out earlyish. Allow them to continue baking on the pan. \n2. Look up tips on browning butter if you've never done it before. \n3. Fold in the butter and brown sugar, and then the flour mixture and chocolate chips by hand. \n4. Rotate pan in oven halfway through.\n5. Put a piece of bread at the bottom of your storage container with the cookies. (keeps 'em moist and chewy in the center)"

I now know it was because I didn't whip the eggs and sugar sufficiently until they formed thick ribbons (takes a while). For the second batch, I whipped the eggs much longer, and they turned out perfect.\n\nI prefer without the extra sprinkle of salt on the end."
