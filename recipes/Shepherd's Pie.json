Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan.

Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute.

Everyone I make it for raves about it!  I have tweaked it to my liking over the years. Ground lamb is hard to find at my local grocery store, so I find the meatloaf mix (lamb, beef, and pork) is a solid substitute. I'm also a huge fan of vegetables so I double the onion and carrots, and I add an entire bag of frozen corn, as well as an entire bag of petite peas. If you do this, you will want to multiply the filling by 1.5 to account for the additional volume. But this is the best Shepherd's Pie recipe I have ever had, whether you prepare it the original way or with my modifications.","datePublished":"2021-12-19"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Corey Kallam"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"},"reviewBody":"Turned out great!","datePublished":"2021-12-19"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Diana080695"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"},"datePublished":"2021-12-18"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carol auerbach"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"},"datePublished":"2021-12-17"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"},"reviewBody":"Excellent recipe - simple yet very flavourful...also assured that there are tons of healthy stuff inside the pie.
