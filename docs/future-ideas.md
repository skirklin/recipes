# Future Feature Ideas

## Building on the Cooking Log
- Sort/filter recipes by "recently made" or "most made"
- Simple stats view (how many times you've made each recipe, when you last made it)
- Analytics dashboard for cooking patterns

## Quality of Life
- Recipe scaling (2x, 0.5x ingredient quantities)
- Print-friendly view for paper copies
- "Cooking mode" with larger text and step-by-step view (pairs well with wake lock)
- Unit conversion (metric/imperial)

## Organization
- Favorites/starred recipes for quick access
- Better tag management (view all tags, merge/rename tags)
- Batch operations (bulk edit/tag/delete)

## Import/Sharing
- Import recipes from a URL (parse recipe websites)
- Easier recipe sharing (copy link button, QR code)

## Known Issues
- What's New modal shows for brand new users on first login - might want to only show to existing users who missed updates
